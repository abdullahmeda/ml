    "The core concept is simple: an **Odds Ratio (OR)** is a **ratio of two different odds**. It compares the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group. This helps quantify how a certain factor (like a treatment or a risk factor) affects the odds of an outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Range:** Like odds, the odds ratio has an asymmetric range from 0 to infinity.\n",
    "    *   **OR < 1:** The odds of the event are lower in the first group.\n",
    "    *   **OR = 1:** The odds of the event are the same in both groups (no association).\n",
    "    *   **OR > 1:** The odds of the event are higher in the first group.\n",
    "*   **Symmetry Issue:** An odds ratio of 0.25 (a four-fold decrease) is not symmetrical to an odds ratio of 4 (a four-fold increase).\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Log(Odds Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the asymmetry of the odds ratio, we can take its natural logarithm. Taking the log transforms the scale to be symmetrical around 0.\n",
    "*   `log(OR) < 0`: The event is less likely in the first group.\n",
    "*   `log(OR) = 0`: There is no difference in odds between the groups.\n",
    "*   `log(OR) > 0`: The event is more likely in the first group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symmetry:** A log(OR) of -1.5 is perfectly symmetrical to a log(OR) of +1.5. This property makes it very useful in statistical models like logistic regression."

It doesn't rely on approximations. It's considered the gold standard for 2x2 contingency tables, especially when sample sizes are small or when some cells have very low counts (e.g., less than 5). For our example, the cell with \"6\" is quite small, making Fisher's test an excellent choice.\n",

    "2.  **Calculate the Chi-Square Statistic:** It measures the total difference between observed (O) and expected (E) counts across all cells: `χ² = Σ [ (O - E)² / E ]`. A larger `χ²` value means a bigger discrepancy from what we'd expect under the null hypothesis.\n",
